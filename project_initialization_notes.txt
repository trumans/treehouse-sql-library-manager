Project Initialization Notes

$npm install sequelize --save
$npm install sequelize-cli  --save
$npm install sqlite3  --save
$npm install express  --save
$npm install pug  --save

$node_modules/.bin/sequelize init

edit config/config.js. set database properties to dialect: sqlite, storage: library.db 
(may need to add "operatorsAliases": false later)

$node_modules/.bin/sequelize model:create --name Book --attributes title:string,author:string,genre:string,year:integer

edit models/book.js to add validation to title and author fields. 
	validate: { notEmpty: {msg: "Title is required"} }

** Video contained instructions to add "sequelize.sync()" somewhere to update database to match model **

Message to slack:

I needed to take a break from treehouse for about a month and unfortunately a lot of knowledge from previous units evaporated from my brain. I know that package.json needs a config start script for "npm start" to work.  Is there an init command that creates that config? Which unit can I re-watch and refresh my memory?
