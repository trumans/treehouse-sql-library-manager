              filtered if the key is omitted or the search value is empty.

# Exceeds Requirements Features #

* /books page contains a search field which filters records as described above in 
  the query string s=value.
* /books page contains buttons to display the previous and next page of books. The
  'previous' button is suppressed on page 1, and the 'next' button is suppressed 
  on a partial page (presumably the last page). Initially, the page size is only 
  5 books to help demonstrate the feature, but can be changed by editing the 
  pageSize variable at the top of /routes/books.js
